* 80% of DevX in 20 Minutes

This presentation is an attempt by me to compress the essence of a 1
hour presentation on my approach to DevX, into 20 minutes.

20 minutes is an aspiration, 80% coverage is also an aspiration.  In
reality it's likely to be more like a 30 minute presentation, and
cover more like 50% of the original scope.  It's good to set yourself stretch goals.
